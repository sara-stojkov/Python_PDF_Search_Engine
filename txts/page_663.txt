Figure 14.9: Example of depth-ﬁrst search traversal on an undirected graph starting
at vertex A. We assume that a vertex’s adjacencies are considered in alphabetical
order. Visited vertices and explored edges are highlighted, with discovery edges
drawn as solid lines and nontree (back) edges as dashed lines: (a) input graph;
(b) path of tree edges, traced from A until back edge (G,C) is examined; (c) reach-
ing F, which is a dead end; (d) after backtracking to I, resuming with edge (I,M),
and hitting another dead end at O; (e) after backtracking to G, continuing with edge
(G,L), and hitting another dead end at H; (f) ﬁnal result.
