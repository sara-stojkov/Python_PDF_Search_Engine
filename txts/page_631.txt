13.5. Tries
609
The attentive reader may wonder whether the compression of paths provides
any signiﬁcant advantage, since it is offset by a corresponding expansion of the
node labels. Indeed, a compressed trie is truly advantageous only when it is used as
an auxiliary index structure over a collection of strings already stored in a primary
structure, and is not required to actually store all the characters of the strings in the
collection.
Suppose, for example, that the collection S of strings is an array of strings S[0],
S[1], ..., S[s −1]. Instead of storing the label X of a node explicitly, we represent
it implicitly by a combination of three integers (i, j : k), such that X = S[i][ j : k];
that is, X is the slice of S[i] consisting of the characters from the jth up to but
not including the kth. (See the example in Figure 13.13. Also compare with the
standard trie of Figure 13.11.)

tation of the compressed trie for S.
This additional compression scheme allows us to reduce the total space for the
trie itself from O(n) for the standard trie to O(s) for the compressed trie, where n
is the total length of the strings in S and s is the number of strings in S. We must
still store the different strings in S, of course, but we nevertheless reduce the space
for the trie.
Searching in a compressed trie is not necessarily faster than in a standard tree,
since there is still need to compare every character of the desired pattern with the
potentially multi-character labels while traversing paths in the trie.
