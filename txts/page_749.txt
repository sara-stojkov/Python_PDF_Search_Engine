The Fibonacci progression is a numeric progression such that F0 = 0, F1 = 1,
and Fn = Fn−1 +Fn−2 for n ≥2.
Proposition B.7: If Fn is deﬁned by the Fibonacci progression, then Fn is Θ(gn),
where g = (1+
√
5)/2 is the so-called golden ratio.
Summations
There are a number of useful facts about summations.
Proposition B.8: Factoring summations:
n
∑
i=1
af(i) = a
n
∑
i=1
f(i),
provided a does not depend upon i.
Proposition B.9: Reversing the order:
n
∑
i=1
m
∑
j=1
f(i, j) =
m
∑
j=1
n
∑
i=1
f(i, j).
One special form of is a telescoping sum:
n
∑
i=1
( f(i)−f(i−1)) = f(n)−f(0),
which arises often in the amortized analysis of a data structure or algorithm.
The following are some other facts about summations that arise often in the
analysis of data structures and algorithms.
Proposition B.10: ∑n
i=1 i = n(n+1)/2.
Proposition B.11: ∑n
i=1 i2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.
