Useful Mathematical Facts
In this appendix we give several useful mathematical facts. We begin with some
combinatorial deﬁnitions and facts.
Logarithms and Exponents
The logarithm function is deﬁned as
logb a = c
if
a = bc.
The following identities hold for logarithms and exponents:
1. logb ac = logb a+logb c
2. logb a/c = logb a−logb c
3. logb ac = clogb a
4. logb a = (logc a)/logc b
5. blogc a = alogc b
6. (ba)c = bac
7. babc = ba+c
8. ba/bc = ba−c
In addition, we have the following:
Proposition B.1: If a > 0, b > 0, and c > a+b, then
loga+logb < 2logc−2.
Justiﬁcation:
It is enough to show that ab < c2/4. We can write
ab
=
a2 +2ab+b2 −a2 +2ab−b2

=
(a+b)2 −(a−b)2

The natural logarithm function lnx = loge x, where e = 2.71828..., is the value
of the following progression:
e = 1+ 1
1! + 1
2! + 1
3! +··· .
