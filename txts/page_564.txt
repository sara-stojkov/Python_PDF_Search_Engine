Figure 12.4: Visualization of an execution of merge-sort (continued from Fig-
ure 12.3). Several invocations are omitted between (m) and (n). Note the merging
of two halves performed in step (p).
Proposition 12.1: The merge-sort tree associated with an execution of merge-
sort on a sequence of size n has height ⌈logn⌉.
We leave the justiﬁcation of Proposition 12.1 as a simple exercise (R-12.1). We
will use this proposition to analyze the running time of the merge-sort algorithm.
Having given an overview of merge-sort and an illustration of how it works,
let us consider each of the steps of this divide-and-conquer algorithm in more de-
tail. Dividing a sequence of size n involves separating it at the element with index
⌈n/2⌉, and recursive calls can be started by passing these smaller sequences as pa-
rameters. The difﬁcult step is combining the two sorted sequences into a single
sorted sequence. Thus, before we present our analysis of merge-sort, we need to
say more about how this is done.
