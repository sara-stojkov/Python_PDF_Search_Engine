Figure 13.9: An illustration of an example Huffman code for the input string
X = "a fast runner need never be afraid of the dark": (a) frequency
of each character of X; (b) Huffman tree T for string X. The code for a character c
is obtained by tracing the path from the root of T to the leaf where c is stored, and
associating a left child with 0 and a right child with 1. For example, the code for
“r” is 011, and the code for “h” is 10111.
13.4.1
The Huﬀman Coding Algorithm
The Huffman coding algorithm begins with each of the d distinct characters of the
string X to encode being the root node of a single-node binary tree. The algorithm
proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, the algorithm takes the two binary
trees with the smallest frequencies and merges them into a single binary tree. It
repeats this process until only one tree is left. (See Code Fragment 13.8.)
Each iteration of the while loop in Huffman’s algorithm can be implemented
in O(logd) time using a priority queue represented with a heap. In addition, each
iteration takes two nodes out of Q and adds one in, a process that will be repeated
d −1 times before exactly one node is left in Q. Thus, this algorithm runs in
O(n+ d logd) time. Although a full justiﬁcation of this algorithm’s correctness is
beyond our scope here, we note that its intuition comes from a simple idea—any
optimal code can be converted into an optimal code in which the code-words for the
two lowest-frequency characters, a and b, differ only in their last bit. Repeating the
argument for a string with a and b replaced by a character c, gives the following:
Proposition 13.5: Huffman’s algorithm constructs an optimal preﬁx code for a
string of length n with d distinct characters in O(n+d logd) time.
