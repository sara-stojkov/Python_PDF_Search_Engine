In addition,
ex = 1+ x
1! + x2
2! + x3
3! +···
ln(1+x) = x−x2
2! + x3
3! −x4
4! +··· .
There are a number of useful inequalities relating to these functions (which
derive from these deﬁnitions).
Proposition B.2: If x > −1,
x
1+x ≤ln(1+x) ≤x.
Proposition B.3: For 0 ≤x < 1,
1+x ≤ex ≤
1
1−x.
Proposition B.4: For any two positive real numbers x and n,

1+ x

≤ex ≤

1+ x

Integer Functions and Relations
The “ﬂoor” and “ceiling” functions are deﬁned respectively as follows:
1. ⌊x⌋= the largest integer less than or equal to x.
2. ⌈x⌉= the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
The modulo operator is deﬁned for integers a ≥0 and b > 0 as
a mod b = a−
a
b

b.
The factorial function is deﬁned as
n! = 1·2·3· ··· ·(n−1)n.
The binomial coefﬁcient is
n
k

=
n!
k!(n−k)!,
which is equal to the number of different combinations one can deﬁne by choosing
k different items from a collection of n items (where the order does not matter).
The name “binomial coefﬁcient” derives from the binomial expansion:
(a+b)n =
n
∑

akbn−k.
We also have the following relationships.
