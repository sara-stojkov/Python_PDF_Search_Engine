values h(p) and w(p) to each position p of the slicing tree such that:

Design a data structure for slicing ﬂoor plans that supports the operations:
• Create a ﬂoor plan consisting of a single basic rectangle.
• Decompose a basic rectangle by means of a horizontal cut.
• Decompose a basic rectangle by means of a vertical cut.
• Assign minimum height and width to a basic rectangle.
• Draw the slicing tree associated with the ﬂoor plan.
• Compact and draw the ﬂoor plan.
