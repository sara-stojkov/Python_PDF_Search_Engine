C-12.54 Show that randomized quick-sort runs in O(nlogn) time with probability
at least 1−1/n, that is, with high probability, by answering the following:
a. For each input element x, deﬁne Ci,j(x) to be a 0/1 random variable
that is 1 if and only if element x is in j +1 subproblems that belong
to size group i. Argue why we need not deﬁne Ci,j for j > n.
b. Let Xi,j be a 0/1 random variable that is 1 with probability 1/2j,
independent of any other events, and let L = ⌈log4/3 n⌉. Argue why
∑L−1
i=0 ∑n
j=0Ci,j(x) ≤∑L−1
i=0 ∑n
j=0 Xi,j.
c. Show that the expected value of ∑L−1
i=0 ∑n
j=0 Xi,j is (2−1/2n)L.
d. Show that the probability that ∑L
i=0 ∑n
j=0 Xi,j > 4L is at most 1/n2,
using the Chernoff bound that states that if X is the sum of a ﬁnite
number of independent 0/1 random variables with expected value
μ > 0, then Pr(X > 2μ) < (4/e)−μ, where e = 2.71828128....
e. Argue why the previous claim proves randomized quick-sort runs in
O(nlogn) time with probability at least 1−1/n.
C-12.55 We can make the quick-select algorithm deterministic, by choosing the
pivot of an n-element sequence as follows:
Partition the set S into ⌈n/5⌉groups of size 5 each (except pos-
sibly for one group). Sort each little set and identify the median
element in this set. From this set of ⌈n/5⌉“baby” medians, ap-
ply the selection algorithm recursively to ﬁnd the median of the
baby medians. Use this element as the pivot and proceed as in
the quick-select algorithm.
Show that this deterministic quick-select algorithm runs in O(n) time by
answering the following questions (please ignore ﬂoor and ceiling func-
tions if that simpliﬁes the mathematics, for the asymptotics are the same
either way):
a. How many baby medians are less than or equal to the chosen pivot?
How many are greater than or equal to the pivot?
b. For each baby median less than or equal to the pivot, how many
other elements are less than or equal to the pivot? Is the same true
for those greater than or equal to the pivot?
c. Argue why the method for ﬁnding the deterministic pivot and using
it to partition S takes O(n) time.
d. Based on these estimates, write a recurrence equation to bound the
worst-case running time t(n) for this selection algorithm (note that in
the worst case there are two recursive calls—one to ﬁnd the median
of the baby medians and one to recur on the larger of L and G).
e. Using this recurrence equation, show by induction that t(n) is O(n).
