Figure 12.2: Visualization of an execution of merge-sort. Each node of the tree
represents a recursive call of merge-sort. The nodes drawn with dashed lines repre-
sent calls that have not been made yet. The node drawn with thick lines represents
the current call. The empty nodes drawn with thin lines represent completed calls.
The remaining nodes (drawn with thin lines and not empty) represent calls that are
waiting for a child invocation to return. (Continues in Figure 12.3.)
