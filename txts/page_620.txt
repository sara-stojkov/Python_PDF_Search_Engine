Applying Dynamic Programming to the LCS Problem
Recall that in the LCS problem, we are given two character strings, X and Y, of
length n and m, respectively, and are asked to ﬁnd a longest string S that is a sub-
sequence of both X and Y. Since X and Y are character strings, we have a natural
set of indices with which to deﬁne subproblems—indices into the strings X and Y.
Let us deﬁne a subproblem, therefore, as that of computing the value L j,k, which
we will use to denote the length of a longest string that is a subsequence of both
preﬁxes X[0 : j] and Y[0 : k]. This deﬁnition allows us to rewrite L j,k in terms of
optimal subproblem solutions. This deﬁnition depends on which of two cases we
are in. (See Figure 13.7.)

Figure 13.7: The two cases in the longest common subsequence algorithm for com-
puting L j,k: (a) xj−1 = yk−1; (b) xj−1 ̸= yk−1.
• xj−1 = yk−1. In this case, we have a match between the last character of
X[0: j] and the last character of Y[0 : k]. We claim that this character be-
longs to a longest common subsequence of X[0 : j] and Y[0 : k]. To justify
this claim, let us suppose it is not true. There has to be some longest com-
mon subsequence xa1xa2 ...xac = yb1yb2 ...ybc. If xac = xj−1 or ybc = yk−1,
then we get the same sequence by setting ac = j −1 and bc = k −1. Alter-
nately, if xac ̸= xj−1 and ybc ̸= yk−1, then we can get an even longer common
subsequence by adding xj−1 = yk−1 to the end. Thus, a longest common
subsequence of X[0: j] and Y[0:k] ends with xj−1. Therefore, we set
L j,k = 1+L j−1,k−1
if xj−1 = yk−1.
• xj−1 ̸= yk−1. In this case, we cannot have a common subsequence that in-
cludes both xj−1 and yk−1. That is, we can have a common subsequence end
with xj−1 or one that ends with yk−1 (or possibly neither), but certainly not
both. Therefore, we set
L j,k = max{L j−1,k , L j,k−1}
if xj−1 ̸= yk−1.
We note that because slice Y[0:0] is the empty string, L j,0 = 0 for j = 0,1,...,n;
similarly, because slice X[0:0] is the empty string, L0,k = 0 for k = 0,1,...,m.
