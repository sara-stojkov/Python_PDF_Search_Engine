Chapter 3. Algorithm Analysis
We note that most handheld calculators have a button marked LOG, but this is
typically for calculating the logarithm base-10, not base-two.
Computing the logarithm function exactly for any integer n involves the use
of calculus, but we can use an approximation that is good enough for our pur-
poses without calculus. In particular, we can easily compute the smallest integer
greater than or equal to logb n (its so-called ceiling, ⌈logb n⌉). For positive integer,
n, this value is equal to the number of times we can divide n by b before we get
a number less than or equal to 1. For example, the evaluation of ⌈log3 27⌉is 3,
because ((27/3)/3)/3 = 1. Likewise, ⌈log4 64⌉is 3, because ((64/4)/4)/4 = 1,
and ⌈log2 12⌉is 4, because (((12/2)/2)/2)/2 = 0.75 ≤1.
The following proposition describes several important identities that involve
logarithms for any base greater than 1.
Proposition 3.1 (Logarithm Rules): Given real numbers a > 0, b > 1, c > 0
and d > 1, we have:
1. logb(ac) = logb a+logb c
2. logb(a/c) = logb a−logb c
3. logb(ac) = clogb a
4. logb a = logd a/logd b
5. blogd a = alogd b
By convention, the unparenthesized notation lognc denotes the value log(nc).
We use a notational shorthand, logcn, to denote the quantity, (logn)c, in which the
result of the logarithm is raised to a power.
The above identities can be derived from converse rules for exponentiation that
we will present on page 121. We illustrate these identities with a few examples.
Example 3.2: We demonstrate below some interesting applications of the loga-
rithm rules from Proposition 3.1 (using the usual convention that the base of a
logarithm is 2 if it is omitted).
• log(2n) = log2+logn = 1+logn, by rule 1
• log(n/2) = logn−log2 = logn−1, by rule 2
• logn3 = 3logn, by rule 3
• log2n = nlog2 = n·1 = n, by rule 3
• log4 n = (logn)/log4 = (logn)/2, by rule 4
• 2logn = nlog2 = n1 = n, by rule 5.
As a practical matter, we note that rule 4 gives us a way to compute the base-two
logarithm on a calculator that has a base-10 logarithm button, LOG, for
log2 n = LOG n/LOG 2.
