Chapter 11. Search Trees
Proposition 11.4: Let T be a splay tree with root t, and let Δ be the total variation
of r(T) caused by splaying a node x at depth d. We have
Δ ≤3(r(t)−r(x))−d +2.
Justiﬁcation:
Splaying node x consists of c = ⌈d/2⌉splaying substeps, each
of which is a zig-zig or a zig-zag, except possibly the last one, which is a zig if
d is odd. Let r0(x) = r(x) be the initial rank of x, and for i = 1,...,c, let ri(x) be
the rank of x after the ith substep and δi be the variation of r(T) caused by the ith
substep. By Proposition 11.3, the total variation Δ of r(T) caused by splaying x is

By Proposition 11.4, if we make a payment of 3(r(t)−r(x))+2 cyber-dollars
towards the splaying of node x, we have enough cyber-dollars to maintain the in-
variant, keeping r(w) cyber-dollars at each node w in T, and pay for the entire
splaying work, which costs d cyber-dollars. Since the size of the root t is n, its
rank r(t) = logn. Given that r(x) ≥0, the payment to be made for splaying is
O(logn) cyber-dollars. To complete our analysis, we have to compute the cost for
maintaining the invariant when a node is inserted or deleted.
When inserting a new node w into a splay tree with n keys, the ranks of all
the ancestors of w are increased. Namely, let w0,wi,...,wd be the ancestors of w,
where w0 = w, wi is the parent of wi−1, and wd is the root. For i = 1,...,d, let
n′(wi) and n(wi) be the size of wi before and after the insertion, respectively, and
let r′(wi) and r(wi) be the rank of wi before and after the insertion. We have
n′(wi) = n(wi)+1.
Also, since n(wi) + 1 ≤n(wi+1), for i = 0,1,...,d −1, we have the following for
each i in this range:
r′(wi) = log(n′(wi)) = log(n(wi)+1) ≤log(n(wi+1)) = r(wi+1).
Thus, the total variation of r(T) caused by the insertion is

Therefore, a payment of O(logn) cyber-dollars is sufﬁcient to maintain the invariant
when a new node is inserted.
