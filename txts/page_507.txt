Figure 11.13: Rebalancing of a subtree during a typical insertion into an A
VL tree:
(a) before the insertion; (b) after an insertion in subtree T3 causes imbalance at z;
(c) after restoring balance with trinode restructuring. Notice that the overall height
of the subtree after the insertion is the same as before the insertion.
