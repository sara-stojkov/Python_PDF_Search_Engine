6.1. Stacks
237
We assume the input is a sequence of characters, such as [(5+x)-(y+z)] .
We perform a left-to-right scan of the original sequence, using a stack S to facilitate
the matching of grouping symbols. Each time we encounter an opening symbol,
we push that symbol onto S, and each time we encounter a closing symbol, we pop
a symbol from the stack S (assuming S is not empty), and check that these two
symbols form a valid pair. If we reach the end of the expression and the stack is
empty, then the original expression was properly matched. Otherwise, there must
be an opening delimiter on the stack without a matching symbol.
If the length of the original expression is n, the algorithm will make at most
n calls to push and n calls to pop. Those calls run in a total of O(n) time, even con-
sidering the amortized nature of the O(1) time bound for those methods. Given that
our selection of possible delimiters, ({[, has constant size, auxiliary tests such as
c in lefty and righty.index(c) each run in O(1) time. Combining these operations,
the matching algorithm on a sequence of length n runs in O(n) time.
Matching Tags in a Markup Language
Another application of matching delimiters is in the validation of markup languages
such as HTML or XML. HTML is the standard format for hyperlinked documents
on the Internet and XML is an extensible markup language used for a variety of
structured data sets. We show a sample HTML document and a possible rendering
in Figure 6.3.
