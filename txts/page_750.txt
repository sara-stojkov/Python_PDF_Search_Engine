Proposition B.12: If k ≥1 is an integer constant, then
n
∑
i=1
ik is Θ(nk+1).
Another common summation is the geometric sum, ∑n
i=0 ai, for any ﬁxed real
number 0 < a ̸= 1.
Proposition B.13:
n
∑
i=0
ai = an+1 −1
a−1 ,
for any real number 0 < a ̸= 1.
Proposition B.14:

∑

1−a
for any real number 0 < a < 1.
There is also a combination of the two common forms, called the linear expo-
nential summation, which has the following expansion:
Proposition B.15: For 0 < a ̸= 1, and n ≥2,
n
∑

iai = a−(n+1)a(n+1) +na(n+2)

The nth Harmonic number Hn is deﬁned as

Proposition B.16: If Hn is the nth harmonic number, then Hn is lnn+Θ(1).
Basic Probability
We review some basic facts from probability theory. The most basic is that any
statement about a probability is deﬁned upon a sample space S, which is deﬁned
as the set of all possible outcomes from some experiment. We leave the terms
“outcomes” and “experiment” undeﬁned in any formal sense.
Example B.17: Consider an experiment that consists of the outcome from ﬂip-
ping a coin ﬁve times. This sample space has 25 different outcomes, one for each
different ordering of possible ﬂips that can occur.
Sample spaces can also be inﬁnite, as the following example illustrates.
