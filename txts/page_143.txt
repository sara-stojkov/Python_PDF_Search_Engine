3.2. The Seven Functions Used in This Book

Proposition 3.4 (Exponent Rules): Given positive integers a, b, and c, we have
1. (ba)c = bac
2. babc = ba+c
3. ba/bc = ba−c
For example, we have the following:
• 256 = 162 = (24)2 = 24·2 = 28 = 256 (Exponent Rule 1)
• 243 = 35 = 32+3 = 3233 = 9·27 = 243 (Exponent Rule 2)
• 16 = 1024/64 = 210/26 = 210−6 = 24 = 16 (Exponent Rule 3)
We can extend the exponential function to exponents that are fractions or real
numbers and to negative exponents, as follows. Given a positive integer k, we de-
ﬁne b1/k to be kth root of b, that is, the number r such that rk = b. For example,
251/2 = 5, since 52 = 25. Likewise, 271/3 = 3 and 161/4 = 2. This approach al-
lows us to deﬁne any power whose exponent can be expressed as a fraction, for
ba/c = (ba)1/c, by Exponent Rule 1. For example, 93/2 = (93)1/2 = 7291/2 = 27.
Thus, ba/c is really just the cth root of the integral exponent ba.
We can further extend the exponential function to deﬁne bx for any real number
x, by computing a series of numbers of the form ba/c for fractions a/c that get pro-
gressively closer and closer to x. Any real number x can be approximated arbitrarily
closely by a fraction a/c; hence, we can use the fraction a/c as the exponent of b
to get arbitrarily close to bx. For example, the number 2π is well deﬁned. Finally,
given a negative exponent d, we deﬁne bd = 1/b−d, which corresponds to applying
Exponent Rule 3 with a = 0 and c = −d. For example, 2−3 = 1/23 = 1/8.
Geometric Sums
Suppose we have a loop for which each iteration takes a multiplicative factor longer
than the previous one. This loop can be analyzed using the following proposition.
Proposition 3.5: For any integer n ≥0 and any real number a such that a > 0 and
a ̸= 1, consider the summation
n
∑
i=0
ai = 1+a+a2 +···+an
(remembering that a0 = 1 if a > 0). This summation is equal to
an+1 −1
a−1 .
Summations as shown in Proposition 3.5 are called geometric summations, be-
cause each term is geometrically larger than the previous one if a > 1. For example,
everyone working in computing should know that
1+2+4+8+···+2n−1 = 2n −1,
for this is the largest integer that can be represented in binary notation using n bits.
