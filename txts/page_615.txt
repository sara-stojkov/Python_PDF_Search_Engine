13.2. Pattern-Matching Algorithms
593
Thus, at each iteration of the loop, either j or s increases by at least 1 (possibly
both); hence, the total number of iterations of the while loop in the KMP pattern-
matching algorithm is at most 2n. Achieving this bound, of course, assumes that
we have already computed the failure function for P.
The algorithm for computing the failure function runs in O(m) time. Its analysis
is analogous to that of the main KMP algorithm, yet with a pattern of length m
compared to itself. Thus, we have:
Proposition 13.3: The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm performs pattern matching
on a text string of length n and a pattern string of length m in O(n+m) time.
The correctness of this algorithm follows from the deﬁnition of the failure func-
tion. Any comparisons that are skipped are actually unnecessary, for the failure
function guarantees that all the ignored comparisons are redundant—they would
involve comparing the same matching characters over again.
In Figure 13.6, we illustrate the execution of the KMP pattern-matching algo-
rithm on the same input strings as in Example 13.1. Note the use of the failure
function to avoid redoing one of the comparisons between a character of the pat-
tern and a character of the text. Also note that the algorithm performs fewer overall
comparisons than the brute-force algorithm run on the same strings (Figure 13.1).

Figure 13.6: An illustration of the KMP pattern-matching algorithm. The primary
algorithm performs 19 character comparisons, which are indicated with numerical
labels. (Additional comparisons would be performed during the computation of the
failure function.)
